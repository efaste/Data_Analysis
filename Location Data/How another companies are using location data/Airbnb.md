How Airbnb use [[Location Data]] for their search feature
-  In order to get the best results, the Airbnb Data Science team included the location relevance component on top of the listing's quality after learning that the [[Location]] of the listing was important to their consumers. The top listings appeared in the locations where past visitors stayed the longest.

- Prices are adjusted based on both the user's location and the locations of the listings in order to maximize the possibility of reservations. To enhance the overall client experience and facilitate informed decision-making, [[Location-specific]] details like hotel availability, local events, etc. are also highlighted.
