How CBRE use [[Location Intelligence]] to improve client relocation 
- CBRE developed a commuting optimizer tool, powered by [[ArcGIS]] , for customers wanting to move their offices while taking staff commute times into consideration. This application generates an interactive map that enables executives to select various locations and view the typical commute distance and time for their workers right away. Usually, hours would be required to complete a task like this.
