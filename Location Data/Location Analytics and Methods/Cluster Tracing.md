## What is Cluster tracing 
- Cluster analysis, or clustering, refers to grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). In all cases, clusters need to be grouped by an attribute or set of attributes.
