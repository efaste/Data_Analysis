- OD study is to determine the travel pattern of an area/city. We can find out the origin (start point of travel) and destination (endpoint of travel) for each person in the city. This will help in the analysis of the travel pattern observed in the city. It forms the foundation for planning transportation projects.


What OD studies look at 
-   Where vehicles are coming from

-   Why people are travelling 
-   When the trips occur and
-   What types of vehicles are travelling
