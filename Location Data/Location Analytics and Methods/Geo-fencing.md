## What is Geofence
-  Is a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area.A geofence could be dynamically generated (as in a radius around a point location) or match a predefined set of boundaries (such as school zones or neighborhood boundaries).Like a real fence, a geofence creates a separation between that location and the area around it. Unlike a real fence, it can also detect movement inside the virtual boundary.

- One of the most common is for location-based maketing. A business with an app can set up geofences to idenfity moblie users in a specific geographic area, then target them with timely push notification when they walk or drive by.
