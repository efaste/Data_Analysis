## What is Mobility Analysis
- Mobility analysis is used to identify trends and examine issues related to urban traffic congestion. Mobility analysis can be used to:
-   Help evaluate and prioritize project needs in terms of the efficiency of traffic flow for development of the Six Year Highway Plan;
-   Compare cities or corridorâ€™s congestion levels; and
-   Set benchmarking goals for future congestion/mobility levels for roadway corridors and cities.
