- There are on average about 39 blocks per block group. Blocks typically have a four-digit number; the first number indicates which block group the block is in. For example, census block 3019 would be in block group 3.

- Blocks are typically bounded by roads and highways, town/city/county/state boundaries, creeks and rivers, etc. In cities, a census block may correspond to a city block, but in rural areas where there are fewer roads, blocks may be delimited by other features such as political boundaries, rivers and other natural features, as well as parks and similar facilities, etc. The population of a census block varies greatly.
