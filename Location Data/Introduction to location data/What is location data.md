## What is location data 
-  Also know as geographic information or geospatial data, location data refers to informamtion related to objects or elements present in a geograhic space or horizon. There are two types of location data: vector data and rastor data 

## Vector data
[[Vector Data]]
- This from uses points, lines, and polygons to represent feartures such as cities, roads, mountains, and bodies of water that are mapped and stored in geograhic information systems(GIS). Type of spatial data used for storing data that has discrete boundaries.

## The characteristics of vector data  
- Type of spatial data used for storing data that has discrete 
-  Discrete data 
- Represents data using sequential points or vertices
- Complex Data
- Administrative borders, linear features, roads and rivers are some examples for vector data

## Raster data 
[[Raster Data]]
- This form uses cells to represent spatial features. Type of spatial data that consists of a matrix of cells organized into rows and columns in which each cell represents specific information. An example would be remote satellite data.

## The characteristics of raster data 
- Type of spatial data that consists of a matrix of cells organized into rows and columns in which each cell represents specific information.
- Continuous data 
- Represents data in cells or in a grid matix
- Simple data 
- Temperature, air pressure, soil PH, elevation, flow and distance are some example for raster data
