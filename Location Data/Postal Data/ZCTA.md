#### What is  ZCTA
- The United States Census Bureau created ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) as statistical units for tabulating summary information. These were first used in the Census 2000 and continues in the American Community Survey data sets for the 2010 Census and five years. This new organization was created to get around the challenges of accurately describing the geographic area that each ZIP code covers. To tabulate census data for a certain region, the extent of that area must be defined.

- Although they are not the same as ZIP codes, ZCTAs are generalized representations of the USPS's ZIP code service regions. The Census Bureau claims that there is "no link" between ZIP codes and Census Bureau geography since individual USPS ZIP codes can cross state, place, county, [[census tract]], [[census block group]], and census block boundaries.
