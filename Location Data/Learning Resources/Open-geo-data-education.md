Link to the repository: [GitHub - andrea-ballatore/open-geo-data-education: Open Geospatial Datasets for GIS Education: This is a repository of open geospatial datasets to be used in an educational context. I created these files over years of teaching Geographic Data Science and GIS. All original datasets are freely available online with open data licenses (see the dataset attribution for details). All the datasets in this repository have been selected, cleaned, harmonised, and repackaged for GIS exercises in a higher-education context. This is a pretty time-intensive process that other educators can hopefully avoid by using these versions.](https://github.com/andrea-ballatore/open-geo-data-education)
